Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.","weeklyDownloads":3085,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/269/269564.png?modified=1652891576","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/269/269564.jpg?modified=1652891576","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1824,"reviewCount":1060,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1690275298000},{"id":"{a6c4a591-f1b2-4f03-b3ff-767e5bedf4e7}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/853/853731-32.png?modified=a1617cd0","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/853/853731-64.png?modified=a1617cd0","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/853/853731-128.png?modified=a1617cd0"},"name":"User-Agent Switcher and Manager","version":"0.5.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4098688/user_agent_string_switcher-0.5.0.xpi","homepageURL":"http://add0n.com/useragent-switcher.html","supportURL":"https://add0n.com/useragent-switcher.html","description":"Spoof websites trying to gather information about your web navigation—like your browser type and operating system—to deliver distinct content you may not want.","fullDescription":"Usage example: You can alter your user-agent string to indicate you’re on a mobile device if you prefer seeing mobile versions of sites so they load quicker.\n\n--\n\nThis extension allows you to spoof your browser \"user-agent\" string to a custom designation, making it impossible for websites to know specific details about your browsing arrangement.\n\nOverviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aVFxvF3N_E\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M6_Zc4o1MQ\n\nNotes:\n1.

With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n    Protect your browsing activity in individual Containers using Mozilla VPN, so you can shop while travelling abroad but check your bank account from a server in your home country.\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers.

The addon will remain available for download as long as the store allows, and the source on gitlab will also remain available to fork.\nI do have a greasyfork account and may publish works there in the future. I have mild intentions to reimplement the core functionality of CSL, IBCP, and DID as public userscripts.\n\nAvailable for Chrome too.\n\nFunctionality\nWhen you select text in a page and your selection contains links, you can right-click anywhere on the selection (or use a browser hotkey) to copy the URLs and/or texts of all those links at once, or open them in tabs.\n\nUsage notes\n\n    right-clicking a link without having selected links will also show the context menu item. Clicking it will simply copy the URL of the link you right-clicked.\n    selecting links, then right-clicking another link and clicking the context menu item will copy the URLs of the links you selected and of the link you right-clicked\n\n\nThe Options screen will automatically open after add-on updates if they force a change to any of your settings.\n\nPlease rate/review/donate! :)\nA lot of time and work goes into creating my addons, and making changes or troubleshooting issues for users.\n\nProblem, bug, broken, question, request?\nPlease use the linked support site or email for all non-review communication. AMO policy protects both users and developers by demanding certain quality standards from addons as well as reviews. Severely disfunctional addons are not published. Reviews and ratings must consider the entire addon, set reasonable expectations, and be timeless: a bad rating focusing solely on a systemic bug or on a problem not suffered by other users will stay long after the issue is resolved. AMO also gives extremely limited communication abilities, so contacting me properly will get your issue resolved much better and faster.","weeklyDownloads":88,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Marnes","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/user/4545060/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/152/152592.png?modified=1622132282","width":700,"height":394,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152592.jpg?modified=1622132282","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":300}],"contributionURL":"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/marnes?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.7024,"reviewCount":49,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/copy-selected-links/reviews/","updateDate":1635606369000},{"id":"{0c8fbd76-bdeb-4c52-9b24-d587ce7b9dc3}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2/2570-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2/2570-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2/2570-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Resurrect Pages","version":"8","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3640440/resurrect_pages-8.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/arantius/resurrect-pages","supportURL":"http://trac.arantius.com/wiki/Extensions/Resurrect","description":"Dead pages, broken links, the scourge of the internet.
